# Financial-Basetable-Creation

## Financial Data Science Basetable Project

This project involves constructing a data science basetable from a financial dataset to then analyze and predict client behavior. 

The basetable includes independent variables, such as demographic and transactional metrics (e.g., gender, age, RFM, LOR), and dependent variables, including binary indicators for loan grants and credit card issuance. 

The analysis aims to derive actionable insights through variable exploration, data visualization, and reporting.
